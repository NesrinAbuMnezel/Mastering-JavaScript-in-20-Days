## Daily Learning Process
1. Each day, i will watch 90 minutes of the assigned courses listed above.
2. Solve all the JavaScript coding challenges that will be provided by the GSG team.
3. Summarize my daily learning and document my challenge solutions on a separate readme page.
4. Repeat the process for the next 20 days, gradually advancing my JavaScript skills.



## Guidelines
- Commit to a consistent schedule and allocate sufficient time each day to complete the learning activities.
- Take notes, document your progress, and maintain a personal learning log throughout the challenge.
- Experiment, explore, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Learning comes from both successes and failures.
- Engage with the other GSG trainees. Seek support, share insights, and collaborate with fellow learners using the dedicated discussion telegram channel.
- Celebrate your achievements and reflect on your growth throughout the challenge.
