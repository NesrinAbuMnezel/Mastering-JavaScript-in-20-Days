## Introduction

In this lesson, we explored hoisting in JavaScript. Here are the key points covered:

- Hoisting is the process of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope.
- Variable declarations are hoisted but not their assignments. They are accessible but have an initial value of `undefined`.
- Function declarations are also hoisted, allowing them to be called before they are defined.
- Hoisting does not apply to function expressions, arrow functions, or variables declared with `let` or `const`.

### Coding Examples

```javascript
// Example 1: Variable Hoisting
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 10;
console.log(x); // Output: 10

// Example 2: Function Hoisting
hoistedFunction(); // Output: "Hello, World!"

function hoistedFunction() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}

```

#### My Solution


```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a  *= 5;
